**Simple**

This is liquid language pulling in some json on the github page. It was so easy to write this. Looking at it I didn't believe it could ever work. 

Worked and was easy to tweak and troubleshoot. 

<ul>
{% for member in site.data.members %}
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/{{ member.github }}">
      {{ member.name }}
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>


<ul>
     {% for doggy in site.data.dogs.dogs %}
     <li>
     
      name: {{ doggy.name }},
      breed: {{ doggy.breed }},
      <img src="{{ doggy.imageurl }} alt={{doggy.name}}">
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
