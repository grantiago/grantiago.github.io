**UFW**

If your going to search for your UFW rules any worthwhile results will be buried by a myriad of crap. Everyone has an opinion on UFW and here is  one more. 

```
$ sudo ufw status numbered
$ sudo ufw allow from 1.1.1.1 to any port 22 proto tcp
$ sudo ufw insert 1 your_rule
$ sudo ufw insert 1 deny from 1.1.1.1 to any
$ sudo ufw delete 1
$ sudo ufw insert 1 allow from 1.1.1.1 to any port 10000 comment 'webmin'
```

**Once a rule is matched** the others will not be evaluated. You must put the specific rules first.

Other than apache(and even some of that), I have everything restricted to my IP with UFW, when my ISP changes my IP I need to open some ports and *Require ip 1.1.1.1.* 

Because of IP ranges with a slash / the usual / delimeter for SED is replaced with \|

    cd /etc/mod*/whi*/
    cd /etc/apa*/sites-a*/
	
find and replace with grep and sed. The -l flag prints only the file name. 

    grep -rl  '1.1.1.1' *  | xargs sed -i 's|1.1.1.1|1.2.3.4|g'
    grep -rl  '1.1.1.1' /path/to/files/*  | xargs sed -i 's|1.1.1.1|1.2.3.4|g'
	
Check if it worked: 

    grep -r '1.2.3.4' *
	
find and replace with find. 

    find . -type f -exec sed -i 's|192.168.0.0/24|1.2.3.4|g' {} +
