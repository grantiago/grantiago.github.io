If you are going to a hunting club, it's best not to arrive in a Subaru wagon. 
You can only make it worse arriving with a couple fuzzy Golden Retrievers sitting along side you in the front seat. 
But that is the hand I've been dealt. Well the Subaru is a choice I made because I'm tight.  
I could have just as well driven out in my Power Wagon at 10 mpg on a downhill. 

I step out of the car into a Bob Seger moment "All the same old cliches, "Is that a woman or a man?" 
At this moment the guy has the balls to ask if I know what i'm doing.  
I give him my standard line. These are my pets (which they are), the hunting dogs will show up in a minute. 
I don't bother telling him these pets have 20 hunting days under their belts for the season. 
I don't make them sit and stay -- their fortee. I let them go: Golden Retriever wild and jump all over him. 

I could make a list of the different breeds of hunting dogs I would like to own. 
Ideally, for where I live, it would be a Griffon. I spend the fall hunting for pheasant and quail on a large farm in Western Idaho. 
A river runs through it. My favorite hunting, hands down, more than an idle walk through the corn, is beating through the coyote-willows along the riverbank. Willows are not where Golden Retrievers shine. In fact it is where they are their most frustrating. Can you say run?

For a variety of reasons, I have two Golden Retrievers. How I became their master is a different story I will explain some other time. 
For the moment imagine these pets, that is how I introduce them, that are obedient and very loving. One has a great nose, big too, and boundless energy. 
The other is beautiful and would hunt for himself on his own terms -- if it wasn't for a training collar. One trots down the middle of the path. The other searches -- hunts. 

For a couple years I hunted over my friend Jim's two perfectly trained Griffons. 
How I miss those days of sneaking up on a beeping point while the Griffons followed that bizzare specialized and bred instinct to point and hold. The golden corn stubble. Fluffy white clouds in the distance. A frozen dog staring down a wild rooster. Pointed tail. Raised paw. Time stopped. A sudden rush of beating wings followed by a single shot. Who could miss with that kind of lob? I miss those days. 

Fast forward -- my hunting days are faster paced: moving quickly through the willows. Keeping pace with the pack. My shots are all rushed. Jamming the barrel through the willow branches. Hoping for the magic combination of a window in the willows and the rooster having the bad luck to pass through it or rise above it. 

For the most part, we are  quiet. Sneaking along and searching and hunting. But there are times when I feel out of control. Especially later in the season when I know the pheasant are hugging the ground and running pell-mell out in front of us. I might as well let the dogs run. But I don't. In the willows I would probably be better off without an advancing Golden out in front.

Did I mention the swimming part? The retriever instinct is facinating. They love to retrieve. Everything withing 400 yards of my house is eventuallybrought to me. The neighbors dog toys, dead birds of any variety, mice, litter, deer legs. But that is nothing in comparision to retrieving in the water. My Goldens go from swamp-collie to superdog in the water. One is a so-so retriever on land, but in the water he is a champ.
